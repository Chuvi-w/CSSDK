An attempt to create a partial source code of counter-strike to be used as useful resources for the AMX Mod X community.

A purpose would be to know more on some counter-strike specificities, understanding the flow of some features, extracting useful datas thus helping the community by creating better plugins which should be more finely, intelligently, and efficiently coded.

The project is based on the HLSDK for at least three reasons :
- It's more easy to insert code inside an existing project using an IDE.
- Can try to compile to see if the code is well integrated and decent.
- A useful online documentation can be generated with Doxygen.

Please don't expect a finished project. CS code will be implemented progressively.
The online documentation can be found here : http://arkshine.github.com/CSSDK/.
